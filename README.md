# rust_path_to_string
Source for an article I wrote exploring some of the usage of the std::path crate in Rust mostly to extract string values. The article, so long as it will continue to be hosted, [can be read here](https://macsimum.life/?p=122).

Rust can be installed or tried out in an online compiler at [Rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

To compile on a local machine, navigate to the rust_path_to_string directory, compile with **cargo build** or **cargo build --release**, and run the executable it produces in a console.

Note that program, as written, will panic!() when run as an executable without an extension.
